# Hindi_Handwriting_Recognition
Hindi Devanagari Characters Recognizer Using CNN in Anaconda(Tensorflow).
I am using Tensorflow as the Framework and Keras API for providing a high level of abstraction.
Classify handwritten Devanagri Characters into 46 classes. The dataset consisted of 92000 **32X32** images. Each image was greyscaled. The entire data was divided into three parts Training Set , Validation and Test set.

First Collect Dataset* For Train Our Model.
Next Install Anaconda3 2019.07 (Python 3.7.3)
In Anconda3 Prompt Create New Virtual environment
After Creating Virtual Environment 
 install Various Dependency of This Model
     install tensorflow
     install keras 
     install opencv
     install Numpy
     
Then Run Model Class For Traing Our Model in Model Class First Set the Path Of Dataset Where you Download it.
                  Run Applicaion Class File Finally
